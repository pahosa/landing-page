# landing-page

This is project is meant to create a landing page from scratch with HTML and CSS based off an example provided. 

By the end of this project I hope
to have demonstrated the ability to create an identical landing page on my own from a blank file based on
the example provided by the lesson in TOP.

Link to example landing page: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png

As part of the project, git commits should also be in good shape as well as this README.md file.
